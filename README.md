# Kickstarter_Challenge

## Overview of Project and Purpose
The main purpose of this project was to analyze different fundraising campaigns in realtion to their launch dates and fundraising goals. 
We were given the informaiton that Louise's play "Fever" came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 
With this in mind we will perform an anlaysis of the specific variables as stated before (Launch Date and Goals).We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, 
the "theater" category is the most successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, 
July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. 
This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. 
As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
This gave me another challenge since I kept finding errors in my formula!

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
-I couldnt figure out why I kept finding errors. Example is Outcomes based on goals, Edinburgh Research and Descriptive Statistics
- My Outcome based on Launch chart does not look the same as the one in the module, I guess because I could organize the years well!

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
First, May and June are the two months that provide the best funding for the category theatre.  
Secondly, avoid the month of Decemeber as it does not provide the best funding for these type of kickstarters.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
No data since my formula couldn't work!

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation of this dataset was that we did not see if the play provided had high reviews leading to a high success 
rate of completing ones goal. it makes sense if the play script is not highly 
reguarded and does not make the goal since people do not want to watch or even perform this act.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
